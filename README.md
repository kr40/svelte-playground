# Svelte Playground

A simple app I made to mess around with svelte in gitpod.io or codesandbox.io.

Comes with a `global.css` file. The `global.css` uses `normalize.css` as a base and adds some basic styles and classes. Helps me to reuse this as a **global** stylesheet in multiple projects.

Link to the `global.css` gist [here](https://gist.github.com/kr40/4d1f60f8005f8ce733b07d6e71233578)

## This is an ever changing project

## You can use this as a template
