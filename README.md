# Svelte Playground

A simple app I made to mess around with svelte in [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/) or [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/).

Comes with a `global.css` file. The `global.css` uses `normalize.css` as a base and adds some basic styles and classes. Helps me to reuse this as a **global** stylesheet in multiple projects.

Link to the `global.css` [here](https://kr40.github.io/global-css/).

## This is an ever changing project, feel free to us this as a [template](https://github.com/kr40/svelte-playground/generate).
